Methods
Statistical Learning Methods:


TODO: 
- find correct dataset to test semantic search on
- read how other people compare this models
- start writing Introduction

TF-IDF
Word embeddings
Sentence embeddings (ton of different chunking ways, shapes etc. what can be written)
BM25
Siamese networks

A tentative outline of your report could look like this:
1. Introduction: Introduce the research questions, why it is interesting and how you are going to answer the research questions.
2. Data: Briefly explain the data that you have, where they are from and why they are relevant for your problem. If appropriate, describe relevant data properties and general data preparation steps.
3. Methods: Provide a short description of the methods that you use as well as a motivation for choosing these methods.
4. Analyses & Results: Describe how you apply the methods and present the results.
5. Conclusions: Briefly summarize your findings and the corresponding conclusions. Relate the outcomes to the research questions.
6. References

* For supervised problems, assess if your models have statistically significantly different performance.
