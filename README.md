Introduction
Semantic search represents a pivotal evolution in search technology, shifting from traditional keyword-based search methods to more nuanced and context-aware strategies. As the amount of digital information continues to expand exponentially, the capability to effectively navigate and retrieve relevant content becomes critical. Semantic search addresses this challenge by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to comprehend the intent and contextual meaning behind user queries, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results.

Research Questions
The primary research question this study seeks to address is:

How can semantic search models be effectively implemented to improve the relevance and accuracy of search results compared to traditional keyword-based search methods?
To delve deeper into the capabilities of semantic search, the following sub-questions will be explored:

What are the key differences in performance between traditional search models (such as TF-IDF) and modern semantic models (like SBERT) in terms of precision, recall, and user satisfaction?
How do various semantic search models manage the challenge of understanding complex queries in a domain-specific context?
Significance of the Study
This study is significant as it addresses the growing need for more sophisticated search mechanisms in various sectors, including academia, healthcare, legal, and customer service. By improving the efficiency and effectiveness of search technologies, organizations can enhance information accessibility and decision-making processes, ultimately leading to greater productivity and user satisfaction.

Methodological Approach
To answer these research questions, the study will:

Review Existing Literature: Summarize current knowledge and theories related to semantic search.
Model Comparison: Implement and compare several models including a baseline model (TF-IDF) and advanced semantic models like SBERT.
Dataset Selection and Preparation: Utilize datasets such as MS MARCO for testing and evaluating the models.
Performance Evaluation: Use metrics such as precision, recall, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to assess the models.
User Study: Conduct a user study to measure satisfaction and effectiveness from a human-centered perspective.
This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of semantic search technologies, focusing on the implementation and evaluation of advanced models, and offering insights into their practical implications and benefits.
